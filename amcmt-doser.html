Hi!!!l am new here on reddit.I am a big fan of I doser I usually listen to it on deezer and I was wondering if any of you guys here know when they will release their new(2018) doses on deezer?I am really excited☺,thank you so much for taking I believe binaural beats are a good assisting tool in meditation to awaken the third eye. I have I-Doser, but they have many spiritual doses to buy, such as: Aura, Telepathy, Ajna, Chakra Total, Transcendence, Qigong, etc. If anybody here uses I-Doser, what dose do you recommend works best for awakening the third. Edit: for clarification, the doses listed below are from my personal experience and will not affect everyone the same as a few of you have pointed out. What I mean by "low dose" is pretty much a dose larger than threshold so that the effects are apparent but still a comfortable, functional high. Edit 2: there are 420 comments you guys can stop now Anyone else seem to prefer low doses of pretty much everything? Maybe I'm just a pussy, but I love getting just high enough to make things interest. From some of the comments in the Deja Voom Facebook page, there seemed to be a serial doser at Deja. Or staff actively drugging people. But to my skepticism, the people crying for help are not wanting to give up details about the incident or be proactive in finding the perpetrator. Anyone else see anything like this down there? My experience was perfect with guest and staff. Nothing wrong other than a few drunk assholes being just drunk assholes. 
Highest dose with no tolerance. Mine was last weekend 2 tabs @ 300mics. Do you not love the feeling of impending doom? Do you not love fearing for the fabric of your sanity? While most individuals can find this state to be traumatizing if unprepared, many people find that, although terrifying, it is potentially exhilarating and character building in equal measure. Pretty much the title. I am looking to get a grinder that can do both jobs, but open to the possibility of getting two different ones (ex. Baratza Encore for coffee, Sette 270 for espresso). I don't mind spending a bit of extra money if it means I can get a grinder that works equally good for both types. I have been told here that the Niche Zero is good, but I am not really sure about it being single dosing. Regarding the beans, I live in the US and can order online from most online stores. Got this Mazzer Mini in a package deal with an espresso machine I bought. Don't need it. Burrs replaced within a year so you're good for a long, long time. I've used it and it works great, I just prefer the speed of my Sette and my girlfriend thinks it's hideous. Asking 0 plus shipping. With how heavy it is I will not quote "shipping included" prices because those costs will vary significantly depending on where you are located. https://i.imgur.com/fIh6Urz.jpg https://i.imgur.com/Ht7izu8.j. 
Ok 2 problems here: I’ve Cleaned and reset the grinder disks, ran the machine and dialled in until I hear the disks touch. Then dial it back again until the noise stops and mark this point on the disk as the finest setting. Now I pour in some beans and the beans won’t grind until I dial in a good few times. But it’s not very fine. I then dial it back and it keeps grinding the beans finer until I get to the mark I’ve made. Why don’t the beans grind straight away where I marked it from? Secon. Recently joined subreddit, and I never knew how interesting making espresso could be. I don't make coffee for a living, and the only reason I started drinking espresso is because that's what I grew up with. THe technical side of making espresso fascinates me. I'm curious what are were your motivations to get into making espresso. For those who keep updating your setups, what's your ultimate goal? What do you strive. I’m just starting out in Espresso and bought a used setup of a Gaggia Classic and Gaggia MDF grinder about two weeks ago. I have since bought a distribution tool and have a bottomless portafilter and a larger 20g basket on the way. I saw a used Super Jolly on Facebook Marketplace that has brand new burrs just installed and have talked them down to 0. Is this a good deal? Anything in particular I should look out for before buying it? Thank. I just got a quote of nearly 00 for a basic chemical dosing pump for my boiler feed water. This seems high and the guy won't breakdown parts and labor. amp#x200B; Boiler is a Rite 105S 1M BTU boiler. My feed water is nearly distilled, super low mineral, 1ppm chlorine. Does anyone know enough about this to point me towards a dosing pump, spec sheet, or technical rep? amp#x200B; Cheers. </p>
